Anybody on campus this year will recognize the big green fences surrounding one of WPI’s oldest buildings, Stratton Hall. Originally built in 1894, this building is being modernized, with the construction effort completely upgrading the lighting, HVAC, windows and roofs, with the possibility of adding solar panels as well. Most importantly to students, TAs and professors alike, they’re finally adding an elevator to the building, which will make getting to that Calculus 3 discussion on the top floor so much easier.

Construction began over the summer with the hall closing on May 30, and should be completed just in time for A-Term 2024. While this construction is intended to modernize the campus and improve energy efficiency, WPI plans for future construction efforts to be focused around improving and expanding options for research and housing on campus.
